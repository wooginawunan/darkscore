        Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
        It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
        Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

        Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
        work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
        Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        In a React app, the %PUBLIC_URL% placeholder is a special variable that 
        is automatically replaced during the build process. It represents the URL 
        path to the public folder in your project.

        When you run the React app locally, the development server takes care of 
        replacing %PUBLIC_URL% with the appropriate URL path. This allows the app 
        to correctly reference the static assets, such as favicon.ico, main.css, 
        and manifest.json, which are located in the public folder.

        However, after deploying your app on GitHub Pages, the build process is 
        different. The %PUBLIC_URL% placeholder is not automatically replaced with 
        the correct URL path, causing the assets to be referenced incorrectly.

        To fix this issue, you need to update the references to your static assets
         to use absolute paths or relative paths instead of %PUBLIC_URL%. For 
         example, you can replace %PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico with /favicon.ico or 
         ./favicon.ico. This ensures that the assets are correctly referenced 
         regardless of the deployment environment.
